Ensemble Machine Learning
# We have simple and advanced ensemble learning techniques which are:-
        1. Simple:
            a. Max Voting
            b. Averaging
            c. Weighted Averaging
        2. Advanced
            a. Stacking
            b. Blending
            c. Bagging
            d. Boosting
            In bagging and Boosting, there are other popular models like Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
